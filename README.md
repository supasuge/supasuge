## Focus Areas
- **Security Engineering:** system hardening, secure-by-default infrastructure, auth/session security
- **Offensive Security:** You can’t defend what you don’t understand, learning how attackers break in is how you learn where to harden first and why. 
- **Applied Cryptography:** practical attacks/defenses, protocol analysis, SageMath tooling, secure engineering, IAM, etc.
- **Automation:** building repeatable, policy-driven workflows (CI/CD-friendly)
- **System Administration/Support:** Managing Active Directory and Linux enterprise environments while implementing the security controls they require.

---

## Recent Work/Projects
- **AutoRed** — compliance and policy-driven, multi-agent orchestrated security assessment tool using an innovative approach combining many of the best currently known techniques and research.
- **CTF content** — crypto, web, pwn, misc category challenges built to teach various security content in a hands-on manner. Or just fun OSINT and Miscellaneous coding challenges.
- **Flask/security tooling** — secure services + APIs, practical hardening patterns
- **Static site generator**: Static site generator written in Python/Flask for blogs including an experimental challenge-response authentication for content management
- [Personal Blog Site - supasuge.com](https://supasuge.com) *(In-progress): My personal blog site for posting various HackTheBox, TryHackMe, and CTF writeups as well as cheatsheets, notes I've accumulated overtime during my time in school, useful resources for various things, random posts on subjects of importantance to me and much more!

## Certifications
- **CASP (Certified AppSec Practitioner)**
- **Security+**
- **Network+**  
- Continuous: labs, writeups, security research, and tooling
- Many more certifications coming in the soon future, I simply lack the financial resources currently to obtain these certifications.
  - If you know of any good, reputable, and **cheap** certification resources, please let me know!
